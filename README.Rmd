<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of `tidycms` is to provide a set of functions to easily access public datasets from Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). The package is built on top of `httr2`. With user-friendly syntax, one can get a tidy tibble in a few lines of code.

## Installation

You can install the development version of tidycms from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JiaZhang42/tidycms")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to glimpse all available datasets from CMS:

```{r example}
library(tidycms)
cms_datasets <- show_datasets()
cms_datasets
```
